# Dribbble 
## Creating a dribble UI and UX with a Plain HTML , CSS , JavaScript

we  will be creating a clone dribble ui and ux , that are already available on the dribbble website . We will try to make a ditto copy of it if possible . though , some of the images or SVG icons will not be available , so its pretty hard to include that . another thing we will be missing is the accurate fonts as there are many types of fonts available , so it is quite difficult to match it .
